    "This notebook will explore the boxplot, also known as box-and-whisker-plot. While widely used in statistics and analytics, it is not as intuitive to read to the untrained eye as many other common graphs, like a scatterplot or histogram. I will give some background on the boxplot, its creator, demonstrate how the boxplot can be generated in Python and also explain the relevant terminology needed to understand what boxplots are all about.\n",

    "The boxplot was introduced in 1977 by John W. Tukey in his book \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" (EDA). Tukey was a founding chairman of the Princeton statistics department and is credited to have coined the term \"bit\" as a shorter version of \"binary digit\" while working with John von Neumann on early computer designs (2). Tukey believed that more emphasis needs to be placed on exploring the data first to come up with a suitable hypothesis, for example by visual means, instead of going in immediately with statistical hypothesis testing. (2) A train of thought that he shared with his colleague Francis Anscombe, who demonstrated on the Anscombe quartet that descriptive statistics by themselves can be misleading.\n",
